# SFU Reviews :zap:

This project is for accepting reviews about profs in Simon Fraser University. My project aims to provide a platform for students to share their experiences with professors and help other students make informed decisions when choosing their courses. I plan to create a system which doesn't do any censorship to the students ratings. Any unacceptable rating would still be accessible and going to be stored in GitHub to provide transparency.

## Technologies Used :hammer:
My project is built using the following technologies:

### BackEnd
- NestJS
- MongoDB

### FrontEnd
- React
- Github API

## Collections :pencil:
I am using MongoDB to store our data in collections. We have the following collections:

[Professors](./Professors.md): This collection stores information about professors, such as their name, department, courses they teach, research interests, and office hours.

[Students](./Students.md): This collection stores information about students, such as their name, email, and password.

[Reviews](./Reviews.md): This collection stores reviews and ratings provided by students for professors.

## Contribution :construction_worker:

I am currently looking for people to work with :blush: and you don't have to be a SFU student for it. I would love any contributions from anyone who is interested in improving this project! To contribute, you can fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
