# Authentication Module Summary

I have implemented an authentication module in my NestJS project using Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication. The authentication module utilizes the `passport-azure-ad` package and integrates it with NestJS' `PassportStrategy` and `AuthGuard` to handle the authentication flow.

## Overview

The authentication module consists of the following components:

1. **AuthService**: This service extends the `PassportStrategy` with the `BearerStrategy` from `passport-azure-ad`. It handles the validation of access tokens received from AAD and provides a `validate` method for additional validation logic.

2. **AuthGuard**: This guard utilizes the `AuthService` to protect routes and ensure that only authenticated users can access them. It is applied as a decorator (`@UseGuards(AuthGuard('azure-ad'))`) on the controller methods that require authentication.

## Configuration

The authentication module requires some configuration values from the environment, such as `tenantId` and `clientId`. These values are used to construct the authentication strategy in the `AuthService`. The configuration is typically stored in a separate `env.ts` file and loaded using the `dotenv` package.

## Usage

To use the authentication module, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies, including `passport-azure-ad`.

2. Configure the environment variables in the `env.ts` file, providing the `tenantId` and `clientId` for your Azure Active Directory.

3. Implement the `AuthService` by extending `PassportStrategy` with `BearerStrategy` and configure it with the necessary parameters, including the identity metadata URL and client ID.

4. Implement the `AuthGuard` by applying it as a decorator on the controller methods that require authentication.

5. Update the `validate` method in the `AuthService` to perform additional validation logic if needed, such as checking if the user exists in the student or professor collection.

6. Test the authentication flow by obtaining an access token from AAD and making authenticated requests to protected routes using the Bearer authentication scheme.

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Azure Active Directory authentication into your NestJS project.
